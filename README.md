# Technical writing portfolio
Hello!

Thank you for your interest and taking the time to visit my technical writing portfolio.

I am a Technical Writer with a 10 year track record of crafting clear, concise documentation for technical products and internal knowledge bases. I have expertise in developing unified style guides, creating templates, and implementing documentation plans that enhance user experience. 

I can identify content gaps and maintains consistent, accessible information that aligns with organizational goals and elevates the end-user experience. I have experience working with mid to large global organizations, both as a lone writer managing projects and as a member of a technical writing team. My strengths include strong communication skills with subject matter experts, adaptability, and quick learning abilities. 

My writing samples include a portfolio website and a section of work I am able to share from a previous employer.
